## üîê RBAC Middleware (In Progress)

We're scaffolding role-based access control using Firebase Admin SDK.

### Middleware to Implement

- `verifyToken`: Verifies Firebase ID tokens and attaches user info to `req.user`
- `checkAdmin`: Checks Firestore for user role and allows access if `role === 'admin'`

### How to Contribute

- Follow the TODOs in each middleware file:
  - `src/middleware/auth.middleware.js`
  - `src/middleware/rbac.middleware.js`
- Use `auth.verifyIdToken()` to decode tokens
- Use `db.collection('users').doc(uid)` to fetch user roles
- Test with the `/api/admin/dashboard` route

Once implemented, we‚Äôll review and compare solutions before merging.
